<h1>THE<br />
<span class="sp1">BIG TOMORROW</span></h1>

<h2><small>BY PAUL LOHRMAN</small></h2>

<p class="bx1"><i>There are certain rare individuals in this world who seem bereft
of all common sense. These are the people who set their eyes upon
an objective and immediately all intelligence, logic, good advice,
unsolvable problems, and insurmountable obstacles go completely
by the boards. The characters we refer to are obviously just
plain stupid. What they want to do, just can't be done. The objectives
they have in mind are unachievable and anyone with an
ounce of brains can tell them so and give them good reasons. They
are usually pretty sad cases and often land in the funny house.
But then again, some of them go out and discover new worlds.</i></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> hadn't gotten any work done
that morning. He'd spent
most of the time pacing the floor
of his small back office, and the
rest of it at the window&mdash;hands
clasped behind his somewhat
bowed back&mdash;staring up into the
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>At ten-forty, the intercom
buzzed. He snapped the switch.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I've got those figures, Mr.
Lake. We have nine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better come in
and tell me personally, Lucy."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Lake."</p>

<p>The intercom snapped off and
a few moments later a girl entered
the office&mdash;if the prim little wisp
that was Lucy Crane could be
so generously classified.</p>

<p>Joshua Lake stared at the elongated
bun of black hair on the top
of her head as she came toward his
desk. There was an odd streak of
rich imagination in Joshua Lake
and he always felt Lucy Crane's
bun was a symbol of disapproval.
"Sit down, Lucy. You use up too
much energy."</p>

<p>"I try to do my job, Mr. Lake."</p>

<p>"You do that&mdash;and more.
What are the figures, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"We're in desperate shape. We
have nine thousand, four hundred
and twenty dollars in the payroll
account. That leaves it over five
thousand short. There is only
about two thousand in General
Disbursements, but that isn't
enough to cover invoices due tomorrow.
I'm afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Lucy. That's
negative. If we waste our time
sitting around shivering, we won't
make any progress at all."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it that way,
Mr. Lake. I'm not shivering. I was
merely stating that we haven't
got enough money."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go to the bank and
get some more."</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Lake. Is that
all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all, Lucy. You run
on to lunch."</p>

<p>"You aren't going out?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm not hungry today."</p>

<p>Her bun bobbed in disapproval
as she left the office. Joshua Lake
stared at the closed door and
sighed. Lucy knew exactly how
things were. She wasn't one to be
fooled. But Joshua hoped the rest
of the personnel were not so perceptive.
The engineers and the
draftsmen particularly. They could
all walk out at noon and be working
somewhere else by one o'clock,
what with the huge current industrial
demand.</p>

<p>He walked again to the window;
an old man; bone-weary, with the
weight of his sixty-odd years bending
his shoulders like a brick-carrier's
hod.</p>

<p>"<i>Then I'll go to the bank and get
some more.</i>" He hadn't even fooled
himself this time. His chances at
the bank were nil. Less than nil.
His very presence there could tip
the balance of their decision. Loans
could be called; the doors locked
before nightfall.</p>

<p>At the window, he lowered his
eyes from the sky and looked to
the gate that led into the horseshoe
sweep of low buildings and
back to the great, bulking hangar
where precious work was being
done.</p>

<p>A man and his dream, Lake
mused.</p>

<p>He could see only the back of
the sign hanging over the gate,
but he was quite familiar with the
other side. <i>Lake Interstellar Enterprises</i>
in bold, brave letters; and
in the lower right-hand corner&mdash;barely
discernible&mdash;<i>Joshua Lake&mdash;President</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A visitor looking closely at the
sign could see that it had been
done over&mdash;that a discarded legend
lay beneath a coat of white
paint. The old name of the firm
was still faintly visible: <i>Lake and
Gorman&mdash;Castings and Extrusions</i>.</p>

<p>It wasn't difficult for Joshua to
conjure up Lee Gorman's craggy,
hostile face. Nor his words. Lee
had a voice like gravel being
ground to powder. A voice to
remember....</p>

<p>"Of course I won't go along
with this damn-fool idea of yours!
Turn a perfectly sound, entrenched
business into a blue-sky factory?
You've gone crazy, Joshua."</p>

<p>"But it's feasible, Lee! Entirely
feasible. All we need is a
little imagination. I've investigated.
I've hired the best brains
in the world. I have all the necessary
preliminary data. A rocket
<i>can</i> be built that will take three
men to the Moon and bring them
back!"</p>

<p>"That's idiocy, Joshua!"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it can be
done?"</p>

<p>"I don't care whether it can
be done or not!"</p>

<p>"But open your eyes, man!
This is an age of development.
An era of movement. We're on
the threshold of the big tomorrow,
and we can't let it pass us by!
We can't let the honor and the
glory go to others while we sit on
our hands and hoot from the
gallery! Come alive, Lee! The
world is passing us!"</p>

<p>"I don't want honor and glory.
All I want is a sound going business.
Suppose we could put a
rocket on the Moon and bring it
back? Where would that leave us?
Broke and famous. And laughed
at probably in the bargain."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. We could
write our own ticket. We'd control
the gateway to the greatest
mineral deposits within reach of
Man! Think of it, Lee. Use your
imagination."</p>

<p>"I won't go along with you,
Joshua. That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>More of the same; days of it,
and finally: "You can have the
customers then, Lee. I'll keep the
plant&mdash;the physical properties."</p>

<p>"But that's not fair."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but it's legal."</p>

<p>"How can I service them&mdash;from my basement?"</p>

<p>"I offered you an alternative
only a fool would have turned
down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That only a fool would accept!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;so now I'm going ahead
and nothing can stop me. I've got
a dream, man&mdash;a dream of a big
tomorrow. I'm going to make that
dream come true."</p>

<p>"Name it right, Joshua. You've
got an obsession."</p>

<p>The end of <i>Lake and Gorman</i>....</p>

<p>Joshua turned from the window,
then paused and looked again into
the sky. The Moon was up, a
round, white will-o'-the-wisp in
the clear blue afternoon sky. He
stared at it and the old feeling of
affinity swept over him, stronger
than ever. The Moon was, for
him, both a goal and a tonic. Sight
of its illusive form could always
sweep away his doubts; straighten
his shoulders.</p>

<p>The intercom buzzed. Joshua
went over and snapped it. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Coving to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Send him in."</p>

<p>Rayburn Coving was probably
the best rocket-fuel man in the
world. He had a little of his sandy
hair left, not much, and his forehead
was permanently creased
from frowning. "I'm afraid that
new benzoic derivative is a failure,
Chief. It piles up corrosion in the
tubes too fast. They'd be clogged
halfway through the trip."</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty thousand
dollars up the spout. Joshua
sighed. "Well, I suppose the
chance of success was worth it.
The added power in relatively
smaller space would have solved
so many other problems."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it failed."</p>

<p>Joshua smiled. "To paraphrase
a certain American inventor&mdash;we're
finding any number of ways
you can't go to the Moon. What
now, Coving?"</p>

<p>"Back to the old method&mdash;and
the other problems. None of
them are insurmountable, though.
A little more time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a little more time."
Joshua grimaced inwardly. He
was talking to Coving as though
they had years&mdash;not as though
their time had run out. He was
even in debt for Coving's labor;
overdrawn on it without enough
money to pay.</p>

<p>The moment of weakness&mdash;of
deep-down weariness&mdash;passed.
Joshua Lake stiffened as he had
stiffened so many times before.
As he had stiffened when Zornoff's
alloys had flunked out and
the first trip to the bank had been
made necessary. The first trip to
the bank. Joshua smiled wryly.
The bank people had been cordial
then. Even servile. Later it had
been different. Now&mdash;</p>

<p>"You were saying, Mr.
Lake&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Morton lately?
What's the latest on the radar
relay equipment?"</p>

<p>"No major bugs, I think. It's
coming along famously."</p>

<p>"Good!" For two hundred odd
thousand it certainly should,
Joshua felt. "Let me know how
you make out, Coving."</p>

<p>"I will, Chief. I'll get the order
in for the new chemicals immediately."</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;oh, yes. Do that. Do
that by all means."</p>

<p>Coving left. Joshua Lake put
his head against the back rest of
the chair and closed his eyes. He
dozed, drifting into a haze from
weariness. <i>It's been so long&mdash;so
very long. Seven years&mdash;eight&mdash;ten.
Ten years. Good heavens! Was
it possible? It didn't seem that long.
Ten years to make a dream succeed.</i></p>

<p><i>Or fail.</i></p>

<p>Joshua slept and again&mdash;as in
the past&mdash;his rest was plagued
with visions. The torment of his
days took many forms in an alert
subconscious too taut to relax. He
had seen before him mountains
too steep to cross&mdash;chasms too
deep and wide to bridge. Often,
when a great problem was solved,
he would look back, nights later,
to see the mountain or the chasm
from the other side.</p>

<p>Now his vision was different.
No mountain before him, but a
face&mdash;the stern craggy face of an
obstacle in his path.</p>

<p>Lee Gorman.</p>

<p>The face was of clay&mdash;yet it
lived. The eyes were cold, disdainful.
And a weird, green creation of
Joshua's own mind was sketching
Gorman in the numbers, signs,
and symbols of a rocket that
would never reach the Moon.</p>

<p>Joshua awoke with a start and
found Lucy bending over him.
"You didn't answer the buzzer,
Mr. Lake. I was worried."</p>

<p>"I must have dozed off, Lucy.
Sorry."</p>

<p>"I'm going home now&mdash;if
there's nothing else."</p>

<p>"Nothing else. I'm going home
myself. Good night."</p>

<p>Joshua paused beside his car
in the parking lot to stare at the
lighted windows of the big hangar.
The second shift had come on.
They would work all night; then,
tomorrow, they would line up with
the others at the pay window.
But there wouldn't be any money.
The next night the hangar windows
would be dark.</p>

<p>He got into the car and drove
home.</p>

<p>Myra was waiting for him. She
took his hat. After he kissed her,
she said, "Your eyes are red,
dear. You've been working much
too hard. Shall we have dinner in
the patio?"</p>

<p>"That would be nice."</p>

<p>Joshua had little to say during
the meal, and Myra was quiet
also&mdash;adjusting herself, as she
had always done, to his mood.
Finally, she said, "That will be
all, Bertha. Leave the coffee pot."</p>

<p>The maid left. A slight chill
was coming in off the desert.
Joshua shivered and said, "We're
through, Myra."</p>

<p>"Through? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"The Moon trip. I can't swing
it. The money's run out. There's
no place I can raise another
dime."</p>

<p>"But you've worked so hard&mdash;and
so long! And you are so close
to success."</p>

<p>"We've made a lot of progress,
but the rocket isn't ready yet.
Now it's too late."</p>

<p>They were silent for a time.
Then Myra said, "In a way, I'm
glad. You should have stopped
long ago. You aren't strong
enough to stand this pace forever.
Now we can go away&mdash;get a
small place somewhere. That
Moon rocket was killing you,
Joshua."</p>

<p>Joshua pondered the point.
"Killing me? No, I don't think so.
I think it has been keeping me
alive."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, dear! You
make it sound so&mdash;so brutal!
Year in and year out. Fighting disappointment&mdash;failure.
Aging before
my eyes while I sit here night
after night!"</p>

<p><i>Fighting disappointment&mdash;failure.</i>
Yes. That was the kind of
fight it had been. How many failures?
The first big one had come
six years before....</p>

<p>"Acceleration, Monsieur, must
be achieved in the first two thousand
miles of flight. After that, the
speed of the ship remains constant.
You follow me?" Tardeau,
the half-mad French genius had
explained it so logically. And
Joshua had believed in him.
That's where you made your big
gamble in a project of this kind.
You selected your men and then
believed in them. Others dissented,
of course. There are always
dissenters. And always points
that could not be proven or disproven
on the drawing boards or
in the test pits....</p>

<hr />

<p>"I follow you, Henri. The
booster units will be in three
sections."</p>

<p>"Exactly, Msieu. The primary&mdash;ah,
booster, as you say, breaks
free at twelve miles. That one,
and the secondary, we control
with radar. We touch a button
and Voila! they are free!"</p>

<p>"In case of the men in the ship
blacking out, I think you said."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But the third will be
disengaged from within the ship
and she will be free as a bird to
fly to your most illusive Moon!"</p>

<p>"And the return?"</p>

<p>"There we have a much lighter
ship, Monsieur. The smaller boosters
will lift her easily. The return
trip will be slower&mdash;much slower,
but she will return!"</p>

<p>Michael Bernard was the dissenter.
"The Frenchman's crazy!
Mad as a hatter, Chief."</p>

<p>"You think it won't work,
then?"</p>

<p>"Too damn complicated. A
dozen units of time and mechanism
have to mesh perfectly. The
odds are against that happening.
After all, you've got to remember,
what we're attempting has never
been done before."</p>

<p>"But if it did work&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It would be a beauty."</p>

<p>"Better than your idea of a
single booster?"</p>

<p>"If it worked&mdash;yes. The
weight problem would be solved.
Five men could ride the rocket.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's try it, Mike. Let's believe
in our destiny."</p>

<p>"Okay&mdash;you're the boss. But
destiny's a hard thing to lay out
and analyze on a drawing board."</p>

<p>A man and his dream....</p>

<p>The radar equipment had failed.
Burdened with the weight of exhausted
booster sections, the rocket
curved back into the clutches of
gravity.</p>

<p>It crashed on the fringe of the
Amazon jungles.</p>

<p>Five Moon pioneers dead. Three
uninsured, dependent families.
Joshua provided for them, but
the critical newspapers overlooked
that point. One editorial
observed that Joshua Lake would
get a rocket to the Moon and back
if it took every able-bodied man in
the country. The project would
have died right there if Joshua
had needed money. No bank in
the nation would have loaned him
a dime. Fortunately he was not
yet broke. He started over.</p>

<p><i>Fortunately?</i></p>

<hr />

<p>At times he had wondered. But
always, his faith had returned to
buoy him up....</p>

<p>Joshua reached out and took
Myra's hand. He looked up into
the sky. "You may be wrong, my
dear. Possibly it's the other way.
A man's ambition&mdash;" he smiled.
"Lee called it an obsession once.
A man's dream can keep him
alive."</p>

<p>"But why does it have to be so
hard? Why can't one of the big
corporations help you? They'll
profit from your success!"</p>

<p>"At least I had no competition
in the fulfillment of my dream."</p>

<p>They were silent for a time;
then Myra said, "But now you
can rest. We'll go away. We don't
need much money. We'll have a
garden. You can lie in the sun."</p>

<p>He laughed softly; not with
humor; rather from a quiet, new-welling
courage. "We're talking as
though it were all over&mdash;finished,
done with. That isn't right."</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly.
"But you just said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. But I didn't really
mean it that way. We aren't
through yet."</p>

<p>"You know where you can
raise&mdash;more money?"</p>

<p>"I know where it is. I'm going
to see Lee Gorman tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Lee Gorman! You aren't serious."</p>

<p>"There's no place else to go."</p>

<p>"You'll be wasting your time,
Joshua. He'll&mdash;he'll humiliate
you."</p>

<p>"He probably will. And I may
not get the money. But there's no
place else to go."</p>

<p>Tears came into Myra's eyes.
"Don't do it, Joshua. Please don't
do it."</p>

<p>"It won't be as bad as you
think, dear. I guess Lee is entitled
to crow a little."</p>

<hr />

<p>Lee Gorman looked at the intercom
on his desk as though it
had snapped at him. "Who?" he
barked. But there had been no
mistake. Gorman sat in puzzled
silence for a few moments. Then
he said, "All right, show him in."</p>

<p>Joshua Lake entered the office
with his hat in one hand and a
briefcase in the other. He paused
halfway to Gorman's desk. "You
haven't changed much, Lee."</p>

<p>"You have," Gorman answered.
"You look like the devil."</p>

<p>"I've been working hard."
Joshua Lake covered the intervening
distance and stood before
the desk. Gorman surveyed him
coldly&mdash;up and down. Joshua
looked around the office as Gorman
sat silent, not inviting him to
sit down.</p>

<p>"You've done very well, Lee.
This is the first time I've seen
your plant."</p>

<p>"I've expanded a little since
my basement days. You remember
my basement days, don't you
Joshua?"</p>

<p>Joshua winced. "Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"And now you might tell me
the purpose of this visit."</p>

<p>"I came to you because I need
money."</p>

<p>Gorman's eyes snapped open&mdash;wide.
He opened his mouth to
speak. He failed, tightened his
throat and tried again. "You
came here after <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Money. I'm broke, Lee. I
haven't enough to meet my payroll."</p>

<p>"You expect me to bail you
out&mdash;clean up your debts&mdash;put
you clear?"</p>

<p>"I came after more than that.
Merely bailing me out wouldn't
help a bit. I need three hundred
thousand to put my rocket in the
air."</p>

<p>Gorman collapsed gently back
into his chair like a balloon mercifully
relieved of some of its content.
When he spoke, it was with
a slow, controlled viciousness.
"I've heard of guts, Joshua. I've
heard of gall&mdash;plain unmitigated
nerve. But this tops anything&mdash;why,
man, you threw me out! You
robbed me! You left me standing
in the street with a bookful of
names and addresses under my
arm&mdash;nothing more. Now you
come here and ask for money!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've done well,
Lee. There was nothing personal
in what I did. I'm glad you've
gone on to even bigger things
than we would have achieved
together."</p>

<p>"You're glad I've done well!
Why, you pious hypocrite! I ought
to have you thrown through the
window instead of merely ordering
you out!"</p>

<p>"There is no reason why I
should expect any better treatment,
Lee. But I had to come
here. You were my last hope. I
had to ask."</p>

<p>Joshua turned slowly from the
desk. He had taken but three
steps when Lee Gorman said,
"Wait a minute. I'm curious. Are
you <i>really</i> still at it&mdash;beating
your brains out against that stone
wall?"</p>

<p>"It's my dream, Lee. I've got
to be the first man to put a rocket
on the moon."</p>

<p>"But now you're broke&mdash;washed
up. What's with the dream
now?"</p>

<p>"I guess it's finished." Joshua
turned and took another step; but
Gorman was loath to let him go.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Gorman said. "What
have you got in that briefcase?"</p>

<p>"Progress reports. Plans. I
wanted to show them to you."</p>

<p>Gorman grinned. "All right.
I've got a few minutes. Come and
do it."</p>

<p>Joshua Lake retraced his steps.
He sat down in a chair next to
Gorman's desk. He laid his hat on
the desk and snapped open the
case.</p>

<p>"No," Gorman said. "Stand
here by my elbow. The chair is for
people I meet on even terms."</p>

<p>Joshua got obediently to his
feet and placed himself as directed.</p>

<p>"And your hat," Gorman
added. "You'd better hold that.
You might forget it when you
leave."</p>

<p>"Of course, Lee."</p>

<p>It was a ludicrous, pitiful sight
but, withal, a grim note ran
through the scene. Joshua supporting
the case against his thigh,
got out a sheaf of papers. "These
are the progress reports to date.
These, the projected plans."</p>

<p>"And when these plans are
carried out you expect success?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Great foresight has been
used. They will carry us through."</p>

<p>"And you expect me to loan
you money on the strength of this&mdash;this
day-dreaming on paper?"</p>

<p>"It's far more than that, Lee.
You'll find the plans sound."</p>

<p>Lee Gorman didn't give a tinker's
hoot for the plans. He was
only enjoying an interview&mdash;a
vengeance&mdash;he was loath to terminate.
"You haven't even begun
to show me what I'd need before I
even considered loaning you a
dime."</p>

<p>"I'll bring you anything you
want."</p>

<p>"Even if I promise to turn you
down after I've gone over it."</p>

<p>"You're calling the dance, Lee."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;I'll call it. Bring
me your payroll records; your cost
sheets; the background reports on
the key men in your organization."</p>

<p>"As soon as I can get them. I
need some money immediately to
meet my payroll."</p>

<p>"Then what are you waiting
for?"</p>

<p>"I'll be back this afternoon."
Joshua was halfway out the door
when Lee Gorman called. "And
bring the deeds to your plant&mdash;the
bills of sale to your machinery
and equipment."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>Joshua left and Lee Gorman sat
motionless staring at the surface
of his desk. There was a Mona
Lisa smile on his rugged face.</p>

<hr />

<p>"It's not worth it, Joshua,"
Myra said, hotly. "You won't
be able to take his brow-beating
and badgering day after day. And
that's his intention. That's what
he's giving you the money for&mdash;for
the pleasure of humiliating
you day after day."</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear. I'm fortunate
that Lee is that kind of a
man. He wants his revenge and
he's willing to pay for it. I was
hoping it would be that way&mdash;praying
for it. It was my last
weapon. The last weapon I had
with which to beat the Moon."</p>

<p>A man and his dream....</p>

<p>"I want you to sign these papers,
Joshua." Lee Gorman held
out a pen and pushed the papers
across the desk.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Lee."</p>

<p>"Four copies."</p>

<p>Joshua pushed the papers back,
looked at them and smiled.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you signed?"</p>

<p>"A power of attorney, I believe.
And I've signed the plant
over to you. There is a large
mortgage against it, however."</p>

<p>Lee Gorman sat back, narrowed
his eyes as he looked at the wizened
little man with the giant obsession.
"Joshua, I think you've
worked beyond your time. You've
slipped your gears completely. Do
you realize that with these papers
I can put you in the street? That
all I have to do is raise my hand
and you're done?"</p>

<p>"I realize that, Lee."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth did you
sign them?"</p>

<p>"I had no alternative."</p>

<p>"But what kind of an alternative
is this? Giving away everything
you've got?"</p>

<p>Joshua sighed. "You haven't
raised your hand yet, Lee. I can
surmount my difficulties only as I
come to them. I'll think about
that one when it gets here."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I've got news for you.
The time to think about it is&mdash;"
Gorman stopped in mid-sentence.
He studied Joshua Lake for a long
minute. Then he took a checkbook
from his desk and wrote
rapidly. "There's money to meet
your payroll. The exact amount.
Take it to the bank. Then, I want
you in this office every day at
four-thirty with a complete report
of what's gone on. Don't overlook
a thing. And bring any bills with
you that want paying, together
with material orders and projected
costs. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"I understand, Lee." At the
door, Joshua Lake turned for a
moment. "And&mdash;thank you&mdash;thank
you very much."</p>

<p>After Joshua had left, Lee Gorman
pondered one of those last
words. If they contained any bitterness,
it was well hidden. "A
strange man," Gorman muttered.
"A very strange man."</p>

<p>If that constituted a weak moment
on the part of Lee Gorman,
his dikes were repaired well in time
to present a hostile front....</p>

<p>"This twelve thousand to American
Chemical&mdash;what are you doing&mdash;running
an experimental
laboratory on the side. I won't
pay it."</p>

<p>"I've never questioned Coving's
judgment in these matters,
Lee. He's done brilliant work for
us. The man has to have materials
to work with."</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly should
have questioned him. He's been
satisfying every whim of curiosity
that pops into his mind. Send
the stuff back."</p>

<p>"But that would be fatal to the
project. The fuel <i>must</i> be power-charged
to safely handle the
weight and time quotients. Coving
can't work with salt and
baking soda."</p>

<p>"I don't care what he works
with. Cut three thousand off that
bill."</p>

<p>"Very well, Lee."</p>

<p>A man and his dream....</p>

<p>"This payroll's out of all reason.
Cut fifteen men off immediately."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>"Cut fifteen men off immediately."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Here's a check for the interest
on the last note. Take it over
to the bank."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lee."</p>

<p>Joshua Lake came and went as
directed. He stood with his hat in
his hand, took orders, carried
them out. His shoulders drooped
a little more; his face became more
pinched; he retreated deeper and
deeper into himself.</p>

<p>But as the days went on, his
eyes brightened and there was a
breathlessness in his expression
when he turned his face to the sky.</p>

<p>Some three months after the
day Joshua walked into Lee's
office, the latter said, "The four
men who are going with the
rocket. You've selected them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They're waiting for the
day. It was a long slow process,
selecting the best equipped men."</p>

<p>"Bring them here tomorrow
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'll check with them. If they
all can't make it, would a later
date&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I said tomorrow. See to it they
<i>can</i> make it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lee."</p>

<p>Joshua brought the four young
men to Lee Gorman's office the
following day. Lee had a buffet
table set up. He was the smiling,
genial, expansive host. "Sit down
gentlemen. I'm glad of this opportunity
to meet you."</p>

<p>There were five chairs in the
room. Gorman had already seated
himself. The young men hesitated.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down."</p>

<p>They dropped into the chairs,
glancing uneasily at Joshua Lake.
Joshua turned and started toward
the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Lake. I'm sure the
boys would like a drink. You'll find
the fixings on the buffet. Why don't
you take their orders?"</p>

<p>The crowning insult, Joshua
wondered. The last, crude insult?
Lee Gorman's wounds must have
been deep indeed. Joshua served
drinks, brought sandwiches. Lee
Gorman's geniality kept the awkwardness
of the situation from
bringing it to a complete standstill.
"Well, Thursday is the day,
I understand. How do you feel
about it? Rocketing off into space.
Becoming a part of the big tomorrow."
Gorman's eyes caught
those of Joshua Lake as he spoke
the last sentence. There was laughter
behind them.</p>

<p>The crew of the Moon rocket left
shortly afterward. Joshua was the
last to walk from the room. Just
as he was going through the door,
Lee Gorman whispered into his
ear. "You can't be sure there'll
be a rocket flight. I might stop it
the last minute. I haven't made
up my mind yet."</p>

<p>Joshua turned and looked at his
tormentor in silence. The others
had gone on down the hall. Gorman
laughed and said, "I suppose
that's a problem you'll face when
you come to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when I come to it."</p>

<p>Alone in his office, Lee Gorman
strode angrily to the buffet. With
a sweep of his arm, he knocked a
liquor bottle across the room. The
motivation of the act was hard to
determine, however, from Gorman's
outward appearance. It
could have been bitter disappointment
or a fierce joy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Joshua Lake walked into Lee
Gorman's office, removed his hat
and said, "With your permission,
this is the day."</p>

<p>"What time?"</p>

<p>"It translates into 4:07 and 30
seconds, Greenwich time."</p>

<p>Gorman scowled. "I suppose
you've arranged quite a party."</p>

<p>"Nothing too spectacular.
We'll leave for the blasting pits at
3:00 o'clock. I'd be honored if
you'd ride with me."</p>

<p>"Do you still own a car?"</p>

<p>"A small one. Its value is negligible."</p>

<p>"We'll go in one of mine. Be
here at five minutes to three."</p>

<p>"Certainly." Joshua put his
hat on and walked out....</p>

<p>They rode across the Nevada
desert in a black Cadillac with the
chauffeur sitting at attention and
staring straight ahead. Joshua
stared straight ahead also. He
asked, "Are you going to stop
the flight?"</p>

<p>Beside him, leaning forward,
clutching with both hands the
silver knob on a black mahogany
cane, Gorman replied, "I haven't
made up my mind yet."</p>

<p>A dot on the desert expanded
into a pit, a tower, and some small
buildings. The car followed the
ruts of the tractors that had
hauled the rocket to the launching
site, and came to a halt.
"That small, glass-encased platform,"
Joshua said. "We'll view
the proceedings from there."</p>

<p>Gorman snorted. "I'll view
them from where I please."</p>

<p>They were standing beside the
car, Joshua slightly behind his
benefactor. "From the platform."</p>

<p>Gorman scowled and half
turned. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I'm holding a gun against your
back. It is a very small gun. No
one can see it and it probably
wouldn't kill you. Then again, it
might. We will walk to the platform
and stand together to watch
the blast-off."</p>

<p>"You'd actually&mdash;<i>kill</i>, to get
that ship into the air?"</p>

<p>"If I committed murder, I
would certainly regret it the rest
of my life, but the rocket must be
launched."</p>

<p>They stood in the glass enclosure
on the platform and no
one came near them. Several people
veered close and waved.
Joshua waved back with his free
hand and the people went on their
way.</p>

<p>An hour passed. There was vast
activity on the field. Gorman said,
"I'm tired. I want to sit down."</p>

<p>"It was thoughtless of me. I
should have provided chairs. It
won't be long now."</p>

<p>It wasn't long. Five minutes
later there was a roar, an explosion
of color, and a silver rocket
flash up into the sky almost faster
than the eye could follow.</p>

<p>Gorman slammed the heel of his
hand against the side of his head
in order to restore hearing. "You
can put that gun away."</p>

<p>"Of course. And you'll want to
call the police."</p>

<p>Gorman growled like an annoyed
bull. He jerked open the
door and strode away.</p>

<p>Three hours later, Joshua and
Myra Lake were seated in the
small patio beside their home.
They were seated very close together,
and Myra was stroking
Joshua's hand. "It's been a long
time, dear; a very long time."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you happy?"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;well, satisfied&mdash;at least
partially. We've passed a big
milestone. But it isn't over yet."</p>

<p>"You're sure this time, though?"</p>

<p>"Very sure."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven we won't have
much longer to wait."</p>

<p>The wait was slightly less than
ten minutes. Then Lee Gorman
strode into the patio. Joshua
sprang to his feet. "Any news?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then they should have phoned
me. I left word to be called."</p>

<p>"No one could get up the courage.
The rocket crashed in Canada."</p>

<p>Joshua swayed. When he looked
at Lee, his eyes were filled with a
mute plea. "That <i>is</i> the truth?"</p>

<p>"It's the truth. The first flash
said it appears the tail broke off
in high space."</p>

<p>Joshua sank into his chair.
"The crew&mdash;died?"</p>

<p>"Four more men sacrificed to
your&mdash;" Gorman stopped and did
not use the word <i>obsession</i>. There
was too much agony in Joshua's
face. "I'm taking the plant&mdash;I'm
taking everything. I've got to.
I've paid for them."</p>

<p>Lee Gorman walked from the
patio. His steps echoed and died.</p>

<p>Joshua and Myra sat for a long
time in silence. Myra was holding
his hand. Finally she spoke. "Well,
at least it's over. Now you can
rest. Successful or not&mdash;you've
earned it."</p>

<p>Joshua turned and looked into
her face&mdash;looked at her as though
she had just entered. "Oh no,
my dear. You certainly don't expect
me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Joshua!"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm only sixty-three. I
never felt better in my life. I have
a lot of good productive years
ahead."</p>

<p>"<i>Joshua! What are you going
to do?</i>"</p>

<p>"I'm going to be the first man
to send a rocket to the Moon."</p>
